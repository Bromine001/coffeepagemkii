        <p>Mix one cup of coarse ground coffee with four cups water in a quart jar.
        Let stand for 12-24 hours. Strain thorugh a

        colador</a> or cheesecloth or muslin bag.</p>
        <p>It will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
        <p><span class = 'note'>Note: this recipe does not follow
        the general 1:17 rule, but makes a concentrated extract.</span></p>
        <p>Mix 1:2 or 1:3 with water. before serving. </p>
        <p>This method for making coffee is unsuitable for drinking hot, it will result in a flat, boring
        cup of coffee with virtually no acidity.  (Many people think it makes tasty iced coffee.) </p>
        <p>Some companies that build equipment specifically designed to make cold press coffee
        make false claims that their coffee has &quot;67% less acid&quot; than other coffees. Do not
        fall for this hype. Coffee has less acid than many common beverages, including tomato juice,
        lemonade, and Coca-Cola. See my article <a class= 'noDeco' href='random.php'>here</a>.</p>
