            <p>The french press is an extremly simple coffee brewing method. You can control the amount
            of coffee, the temprature of the water, and the extraction time. The biggest upside of the press
            is that every aspect of brewing can be controlled manually. Unfortunatly, that is also the biggest
            downside. Meaning that it is fairly easy to screw up through inattention. </p>
            <p>This Bodum is the workhorse of our coffee making machines. We drink
            a pot of french press coffee pretty much every day around here. The standard 32 oz.
            press is the perfect size for splitting between two people.</p>

            <p>Equipment you will need for your coffee: </p>
            <p>A French press, a cup or two,
            coffee, a kettle of boiling water. You will also need a plastic spoon or chopstick
            and a timer (not pictured).</p>

            <p>I always reccomend weighing out your coffee whenever possible. This will lead
            to the most consistent results. </p>
            <p>French press carafes will
            hold 32 ounces total. After the grounds are in, that
            leaves room for about 30 ounces water. I weigh out 1.8 ounces beans for a standard size
            French press. </p>

            <p>Start by grinding fresh coffee coarsely, as you would for a percolator. More finely ground
            coffee will make it very hard to press down the plunger.</p>

            <p>Pour the grounds into your press.</p>
            <p>In this picture you can see the spacer I had to put into the top band on this press.
            Bodum makes many different models, some with a plastic framework around the carafe and some
            with stainless steel. I really like the stainless banding, but it didn't fit very well and it
            allowed the carafe to rattle around. That is a piece of old bicycle innertube that I cut and
            put in as a spacer. It works pretty well, though I should probably slip it back into place.</p>

            <p>Boil some water in your kettle, then give it a minute to cool
            from 212 to about 205. Then fill your press with hot water. I usually fill to about the top
            of the band. You don't want to fill it up to the spout, or it will spill when you put the lid on. </p>

            <p>Give it a quick stir with a plastic or wooden utensil -- don't use a metal knife or spoon. 
            Set a timer for 3 minutes. </p>

            <p>Put the lid on, and adjust the plunger so that the grounds
            are held under the surface of the water.</p>
            <p>When your time is up, gently but firmly push the plunger down, and pour. </p>
