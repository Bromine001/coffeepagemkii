   <h4> Making (or not making) espresso.</h4>

    <p>Espresso is delicious, but we don't recommend trying to make
            espresso at home. Proper espresso requires an extremely temperature stable source of water,
            which means a big boiler. It also requires enormously high pressure to pull properly, and
            to extract all of the desired compounds from the grounds, 9 bars of pressure to be exact.
            Espresso is also the trickiest method of coffee making, needing constant adjustment of both the
            grinder and of the machine itself. It is so tricky, in fact, that many professional
            baristas aren't able to do a decent job with it. There are plenty of
            "home espresso" machines out there, but few of them make a drink that bears more than a
            passing resemblance to espresso. If you can't live without your espresso fix at home,<img class= 'imLeft' src= 'cpics/S1_Vivaldi.png' /> you
            have two good options. The first is the <a class= noDeco href='http://www.laspaziale.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=66&lang=en'>
            Spaziale Vivaldi S1</a>, a high quality
            pro-sumer machine that makes perfectly good espresso.  Note that it needs to be plumbed in to your
            water supply and needs at least a 110 volt, 15 amp dedicated circuit.
            The second is an AeroPress, which doesn't make espresso, but
            makes a concentrated coffee extract which is as close as most home espresso machines
            can make, even some that cost 20 times as much. </p>
