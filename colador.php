        <h3>Cofee in a camping colador</h3>

            <img class= bigLeft src= 'cpics/coladorm20.JPG' title='Coffee!'>
            <p>A colador is a great and simple way to make coffee without electricty and with a minimum of
            equipment. I have been using this method for camping coffee for seven years.  When I'm backpacking, 
            I usually pour the coffee into a Nalgene bottle instead of the second pot, since I don't carry both
            of these pots. If you are using a Nalgene bottle or something with a similarly narrow neck, it's a good
            idea to wear a glove on the hand that's holding the bottle, as it's very easy to spill boiling water out
            onto your hand.</p>
            <p>If you are using a colador you purchased, all of the directions will be the same, but it will
            have a handle to keep your hand out of the aforementioned spilling boiling water. I know that the directions
            included with commercial coladors recommend less steeping time and a finer grind of coffee. I find
            that leaves more fines in my coffee and makes the filtering take much longer, so I prefer to
            steep coarse grounds longer, then filter them out.</p>

            <p>Start with a simple bag sewn out of muslin. You really don't necessarily need a sewn bag.
            You can use any number of things for this. For years I simply used a big square of muslin cloth.

            <p>Gather your materials. <br> You will need a pot for water, a second pot for the coffee (or a Nalgene,
            big mug or thermos), your colador, a stirring implement, and some ground coffee.</p>

            <p>Weigh out your coffee grounds. A great aspect of this method is that it can be scaled up
            however much you like. A pillowcase and a stockpot could be used to make a gallon or three
            of coffee in one batch.
            Grind your weighed out coffee coarsely (remember our 1:17 ratio)
            <span class = 'note'> Note: I like to make about 26 ounces of coffee at a time,
            so I start with 1.5 ounces grounds. </span>   </p>

            <p>Boil some water. <br>
            Let your water cool for a minute from 212 to 205.</p>

            <p>Place the colador into a second pot (or bottle or mug).</p>

            <img class= bigLeft src= 'cpics/coladorm07.JPG' title='Pretty self evident.'>
            <p>Pour your measured grounds into the colador. When camping, I usually grind all of my beans at
            home, then pour the grounds into a Zip-Loc bag. On the trail, I just estimate 1.5 ounces when
            pouring them into the pot. You could easily throw in a coffee scoop or use a spoon to scoop the
            grounds in.

            <p>Pour water over your grounds. Give it a stir to make sure all of the grounds are wet.
            Put a lid on to keep the heat in. Let it steep for three minutes.</p>

            <p>Pull the colador out of the coffee, let drip for a few seconds. You can squeeze the
            bag by twisting or by wrapping it around a spoon if you like, or you can simply be patient
            and allow it to drip.</p>

            <img class= bigLeft src= 'cpics/coladorm23.JPG' title=''>
            <p>Shake out the grounds and rinse the colador. Rinsed and wrung out, my colador is generally
            dry enough to fold up and pack by the time we have camp struck. If it's not, I will hang it
            on the outside of my pack for the morning. Alternatly, you can shake out the grounds and
            lay the colador out to dry some. Once it is fairly dry, you can easily brush off most of
            the coffee grounds and fines left on it, without needing to rinse.</p>

            <p> Note: A commercial Colador works very similarly, simply follow the same directions, using your purchased
            colador instead of the musilin bag. </p>
            <p>A downside of this method is that it can't scale up, but an upside is that if you buy a
            colador, it will have a handle built in.  This can save you some scaleded fingers if you aren't
            careful pouring hot water.  <a class= noDeco href='http://www.amazon.com/Bene-Casa-BC-85024-Colador-Coffee/dp/B008SGAGR0'>
