               Espresso mixed with hot water, to approximate the strength of brewed coffee. Common dilutions
               range anywhere from 1:2 to 1:10 of espresso to water. Originally invented in Italy, where American
               soldiers on leave wanted cups of brewed coffee, but the Italian cafes only had espresso machines.</p>

                A mix of espresso and steamed milk. Generally uses much stiffer foam than a latte.
                Traditionally cappuccinos are served in a 1:1:1 ratio between espresso: liquid milk: milk foam.
                This generates a 5-6 ounce drink. In the US, a cappuccino is often served in a 16 or 20 ounce size,
                generally with one or two shots of espresso, much more like a stiff latte than a traditional
                cappuccino.</p>

                The most common coffee drink in the US. A latte is a mix of espresso and

                Coffee made with a Moka pot. Similar to espresso, but made with much lower 
                pressure than espresso. Moka pots are sometimes sold as "stovetop espresso" machines.
                They are tricky to use, time consuming to clean, and they make a drink which is tasty, but

                Like the French Press, a pour over is really an extraction method rather than a drink.
                A pour over is basically brewed coffee. It only differs in that it is made by hand, generally with
                a Melitta or a Hario V-60.</p>

                a pot with a plate in the bottom hooked to a central tube that extends to the top of the pot.
                As water boils, it is forced up the tube to splash repeatedly over a basket of grounds which
                is also suspended in the pot above the level of the water.</p>
                <p>As this method involves re-circulating the coffee through the basket, and using water
                which is at 212 deg. We do not reccomend it as a preparation method. It tends to lead to a
                badly overextracted coffee, which is extremely bitter. </p>
