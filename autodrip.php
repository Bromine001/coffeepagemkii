        <p>Most automatic drip machines have some issues. They can't make particularly
        good coffee for two reasons. First, they only get the water to about 185 degrees. Second,
        they cannot hold enough coffee to make the proper strength brew. Yes, this is actually true.
        For the full 60 ounces
        in a 12 cup maker, you should have about 3.25 ounces of coffee grounds, which would
        overfill the basket. </p>
        <p>Here are some directions for getting the most out of your automatic drip maker.</p>
        <p>First, grind some coffee to a medium grind. Use a finer grind if you have a cone filter, or a
        coarser grind if you are using a mesh basket.</p>
        <p>Put a filter into the brewing basket, and fill about halfway with fresh grounds. Don't fill
        it further than halfway, since the coffee needs room to mix with water. If you overfill the basket, it will
        overflow and make a giant mess.</p>
        <p>Fill the carafe about halfway -- to the 6 cup mark in most makers. </p>
        <p>Pour into the reservoir and turn it on.</p>
        <p> Wait until it's done making noise, then turn off the hot plate and enjoy your coffee! You can pour it into
        a thermos if you want to keep your coffee hot for longer than 20 minutes or so.</p>
        <p><span class= note>Pro tip: Do not use the "steal a cup" feature. It will not only
        wind you up with a poor cup of coffee, it will also degrade the entire pot.</span></p>
