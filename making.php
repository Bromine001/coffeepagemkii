        <h4 class = clear>How much coffee to use</h4>
        <img class = 'imLeft' src = 'cpics/brewChart.JPG' title= 'enormously useful but highly confusing chart'/>
        <p> Most people don't put enough ground coffee beans into their coffee. It's an easy mistake to make.
        Not using enough grounds will make your coffee taste very bitter.  Many people associate this with
        coffee being too strong. It seems counter intuitive, but the opposite is true, and here's why: in
        making coffee, the goal is not to extract all the soluble compounds from the grounds, only some of
        them.  Too weak a brew allows the water to dissolve many undesirable
        compounds into your extract, which carry an excessively bitter taste.</p>
        <p>This chart can be hard to read, but a good baseline rule is a 1:17 ratio of coffee:water.
        Depending on your exact method for extraction, this ratio may vary.   </p>
        <p>The water needs to be 195-205 degrees F (90-96 C) for optimal extraction.
        Lower tempratures will result in flat, underdeveloped flavors, while higher temperatures
        will extract undesired compounds. </p>
        <p>Time in contact with the water will vary based on the particle size of the coffee you are using.
        It can vary from anywhere between about 8 seconds for espresso, to steeping for about 3 minutes for French press.
        The time is only a general trend, and will of course also vary based on the exact method you are using.</p>
        
        <h4 class = clear>How to grind coffee</h4>
        <p><img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/burrGrinder.jpeg' title= 'Hario burr grinder, highly recommended' /> Burr
        grinders are preffered for grinding coffee
        <a class= 'noDeco' href = 'http://gearpatrol.com/2013/02/25/grind-it-out-10-best-coffee-grinders/'>
        (shop for burr grinders here)</a>. A burr grinder works by the action of a toothed plate that spins at a set
        distance from a second toothed plate, which is fixed in place.
        <img class= 'imRight' src='cpics/pressm06.JPG' title ='Hopper full of coffee' />The coffee beans are poured
        into the center, and make their way towards the edges, and can only fit through between the edges of the plate
        once they have been ground to a sufficently small size. Once they have reached the edge, the grounds will fall
        into a collection hopper, and be away from any further grinding. Burr grinders are used in all professional
        applications where coffee is ground.  If you're serious about your coffee, the investment in a decent home
        grade burr grinder is well worth the expense.  Blade grinders are much less expensive, but generate a very
        irregular size particle, which is less than ideal for any sort of coffee application.
