            <h4>All you ever wanted to know and more.</h4>
            <p> <img class= 'imRight' src= 'cpics/espresso2.JPG' />
                Many blends are labeled &quot;espresso blend&quot;. This does not mean that they are only used for
            espresso, or that they are only good for espresso, or that they are &quot;stronger&quot;.
            The concentrated nature of espresso means that any flaw in the beans will become
            readily apparent to the drinker, so nearly every coffee roaster creates a specific blend
            that they use for their espresso, which will often be labeled &quot;espresso blend&quot;. This really
            indicates that it is a blend of beans that has been very carefully balanced so that it will
            make good espresso. That careful balancing will also mean it will be good with any sort of extraction
            method you choose to use.</p>
            
            <p><img class= 'bigLeft' src= 'cpics/espresso3.JPG' />Espresso is generally sold by the one ounce &quot;shot&quot;. It is generally served in demitasse cups,
            sometimes with a piece of chocolate, a slice of lemon, or a sugar cube. Many coffeeshops pull their
            espresso two shots at a time, in a &quot;double&quot; portafilter. Due to a combination of this and its
            generally small volume, the most common quantity of espresso is the &quot;double shot&quot;, somewhat
            obviously consisting of two shots pulled from a single portafilter.</p>
