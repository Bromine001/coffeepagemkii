        <p>Equipment you will need for your coffee: </p>
        <p>A French press, a cup or two,
        coffee, a kettle of boiling water. You will also need a plastic spoon or chopstick
        and a timer (not pictured).</p>
    </div>
    <div>       
            <img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/pressm05.JPG' title= 'my scale' />
            <p>I always reccomend weighing out your coffee whenever possible. This will lead
            to the most consistent results. </p>
            <p>French press carafes will
            hold 32 ounces total. After the grounds are in, that
            leaves room for about 30 ounces water. I weigh out 1.8 ounces beans for a standard size
            French press. </p>

    <div>
            <img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/pressm06.JPG' title= 'ground coffee in hopper' />
            <p>Start by grinding fresh coffee coarsely.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
            <img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/pressm07.JPG' title= 'Into the pot' />
            <p>Pour the grounds into your press. </p>
    </div>

            <img class= 'imRight' src='cpics/pressm12.JPG' title= '' />
            <p>Boil some water in your kettle, then give it a minute to cool
            from 212 to about 205. Then fill your press with hot water. </p>
    </div>
    <div>   
            <img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/pressm13.JPG' title= 'a metal spoon could crack your press. I use a plastic chopstick.' />
            <p>Give it a quick stir with a plastic or wooden utensil -- don't use a metal knife or spoon. 
            Set a timer for 3 minutes. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
            <img class= 'imRight' src='cpics/pressm15.JPG' title= 'the screen helps hold the grounds all under the water' />
            <p>Put the lid on, and adjust the plunger so that the grounds
            are held under the surface of the water.</p>
            <p>When your time is up, gently but firmly push the plunger down, and pour. </p>

            <p>Coffee!</p>
