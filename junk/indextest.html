        <h3>It's the stuff of legend and myth. It's dark and mysterious.
        It's coffee.</h3>
                                                                        
<p><img class= 'imLeft' src= 'cpics/glassCoffee.JPG' />People drink a lot of coffee. It&#39;s one of the most popular beverages in the world,
it's the second most traded commodity in the world (oil is first)<a class= 'noDeco'
href= 'http://bestteneverything.com/top-ten-most-traded-commodities/'>&#42;</a>, there are
whole industries built around the stuff, and you probably don't understand it at
all. Don't feel bad--most people don't. <img class= 'imRight' src= 'cpics/latte.JPG'>
From the myths of Kaldi and his dancing goats to patently absurd claims about acid,
coffee is steeped in misinformation, and one of the things I hope to teach here is

<p>As an experienced barista and coffee roaster, I naturally have a lot to say
about coffee, and a passion for debunking myths and rumors about my beverage of
choice. Read on to learn all you ever wanted to know about coffee...and a bunch of
stuff you thought you knew but were, in fact, totally wrong about.
