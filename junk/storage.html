            <h3> Care and storage of coffee </h3>
            <img class= 'bigLeft' src='cpics/beans01.JPG' title= 'Fresh out of the roaster'>
            <p> Many people store their coffee poorly or incorrectly. Green coffee can store
            for months with no problems, but once roasted, coffee beans have a very limited lifespan.
            If left in whole beans, coffee will last a couple of weeks after it's roasted. If ground,
            it will last less long than that, based on the greater surface area exposed to the air. Ground coarsely,
            as for a French press, it will age about 100 times faster than in whole bean
            form (as it has aound 100
            times the surface area now) -- so it will start to become noticeably stale in several hours.
            Ground very finely, as for espresso, it will age about a thousand times faster,
            (again, now having around a thousand times the surface area), so it should be brewed within a minute or
            so.  </p>
            <p>Coffee needs to &quot;outgas%quot; as it ages. Starting the minute it comes out of the roaster,
            it starts to get stale. As it stales, it releases carbon dioxide gas. It only stops once it
            is fully stale. That is why the coffee you buy at the grocery store has vents in the bags.
            The contents would inflate and eventually rupture the bags without a pressure
            release. Any coffee that you purchase in a can is already fully stale; it must be made
            completely stale before it can be packaged into a can. </p>
            <p>You can delay this action by freezing your coffee. I don't really recommend freezing, as it
            damages the coffee beans, but if you need to keep your coffee for more than a couple of
            weeks, freezing is better than leaving it out. On the other hand, moisture is the worst
            thing for your beans, and the condensation from the cold air in the refrigerator is far more
            damaging to your coffee beans than being left to outgas, so never put your coffee in the
            refrigerator.</p>  <p><span class= 'note'> Pro tip: The outgassing of extremely fresh coffee
            beans will create a severe turbulence when they are exposed to water. The more finely ground the
            coffee is, the more significant the sudden burst of outgassing will be. This makes extremely fresh
            coffee make very poor espresso, as it will behave unpredictably in the portafilter. To make
            espresso, beans need to age for three to five days before they can be used.</span></p>
