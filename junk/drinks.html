        <h3> Common coffee drinks.</h3>
        <p> This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, merely representative of common drinks
        you are likely to encounter.</p>

        <dd><p><img class= 'imLeft' src = 'cpics/coffeeCream.JPG' title= 'looks just like a regular old cup
        of coffee.' />
        Espresso mixed with hot water, to approximate the strength of brewed coffee. Common dilutions
        range anywhere from 1:2 to 1:10 of espresso to water. Originally invented in Italy, where American
        soldiers on leave wanted cups of brewed coffee, but the Italian cafes only had espresso machines.</p>

        <dd><p>Technically any coffee drink made with half and half, more typical usage is a latte

    <dt><b>Cafe au lait</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Brewed coffee topped with steamed milk. Generally served in a 1:1 ratio.</p>
    </dd>
        
    <dt><b>Cowboy coffee</b></dt>
        <dd><p>A method of making coffee, where water is boiled, then grounds added, then allowed to settle
        but not removed before drinking. There are various methods for minimizing the grounds in the cup
        including cracking a raw egg into the pot, adding an ice cube, and tapping the side of the pot.</p>
        <p>None of these methods is particularly effective. Due to the continued presence of grounds,
        we don't recommend this method of preparation. </p>

    <dt><b>Cubano</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Specifically it is espresso sweetened with sugar added into the portafilter.</p>
        <p><span class = 'note'> Pro tip: This is a foolish practice which not only makes a terrible
        shot of espresso, but will wear out an espresso machine prematurely. A very similar effect can
        be more effectively achieved by pouring sugar into the shot glass to dissolve as the espresso drips
        out.</span></p>

    <dt><b>Cappuccino</b></dt>
        <dd><p><img class= 'imRight' src= 'cpics/capp.JPG' />
        A mix of espresso and steamed milk. Generally uses much stiffer foam than a latte.
        Traditionally cappuccinos are served in a 1:1:1 ratio between espresso: liquid milk: milk foam.
        This generates a 5-6 ounce drink. In the US, a cappuccino is often served in a 16 or 20 ounce size,
        generally with one or two shots of espresso, much more like a stiff latte than a traditional
        cappuccino.</p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt><b>Cortado</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Espresso mixed with warm milk in a 1:1 ratio. Often drunk by people who like espresso but

    <dt><b>French Press</b></dt>
        <dd><p>An extraction method rather than a drink per se. In a French press (or Bodum, or plunger press),
        the grounds are separated using a fine metal screen rather than a paper filter. The resultant
        coffee is thicker, with a more robust body than the same coffee made in a drip maker.

        <dd><p><img class='imLeft' src= 'cpics/latte5.JPG' />
        <img class= 'imRight' src= 'cpics/latteaction.JPG' />
        The most common coffee drink in the US. A latte is a mix of espresso and
        steamed milk. Traditionally in a 1:3 ratio, though more common in the US
        is anywhere between a 1:5 and 1:16 ratio. Often served with flavored sugar
        syrup or chocolate.</p>
        <p>Lattes are generally made with either one or two shots of espresso.
        Generally served in 8, 12, 16, or 20 oz. sizes.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id= 'mocha'><b>Mocha (Cafe mocha)</b></dt> 
        <dd>
        <p>A variant of a latte with chocolate added. These are served at a variety of sweetnesses
        and strengths, sometimes with dark chocolate, and sometimes with white chocolate.</p>
        <p>&quot;Turtle&quot; lattes are a variant made with caramel and chocolate.</p>
        <p>&quot;Nutella&quot; lattes are another variant made with hazlenut syrup and chocolate.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Macchiato</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Espresso with a scoop of milk foam on top. Usually either a single or double shot, served
        in a demitasse cup.</p>
        <p><span class = 'note'>Note: A &quot;Caramel
        Macchiato&quot; is a Starbucks drink, not a coffee shop drink. To get a Starbucks Caramel
        Macchiato in a different coffee shop, you should order a caramel vanilla latte.</span></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><b>&quot;Low Acid&quot; coffee</b></dt>
        <dd><p>A bulls**t marketing gimmick that preys on people who are misinformed about the
        difference between the flavor &quot;acidity&quot; and the pH of coffee. Coffee is far
        less acidic than Lemonade, Coca-Cola, or tomatoes. See my article about 
        <a class= 'noDeco' href='random.html'>acidity in coffee</a>.</p>
    </dd>
        
    <dt><b>Moka</b></dt>
        <dd><p><img class= 'imLeft' src= 'cpics/moka.JPG' />
        Coffee made with a Moka pot. Similar to espresso, but made with much lower 
        pressure than espresso.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Pour over</b></dt>
        <dd><p><img class= 'imRight' src= 'cpics/carafe.JPG' />
        Like the French Press, a pour over is really an extraction method rather than a drink.
        A pour over is basically brewed coffee. It only differs in that it is made by hand, generally with
        a Melitta or a Hario V-60.</p>

    </dd>
    
    <dt id= 'redEye'><b>Percolator</b></dt>
        <dd><p>An old fashioned method for brewing coffee, rather than a drink. A percolator is
        a pot with a plate in the bottom hooked to a central tube that extends to the top of the pot.
        As water boils, it is forced up the tube to splash repeatedly over a basket of grounds which
        is also suspended in the pot over the level of the water.</p>
        <p>As this method involves re-circulating the coffee through the basket, and using water
        which is at 212 deg. We do not reccomend it as a preparation method. It tends to lead to a
        badly overextracted coffee, which is extremely bitter. </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Red Eye</b>(Green Eye, Black Eye, etc.)</dt> 
        <dd><p>Brewed coffee with espresso. Generally one shot for a Red Eye.</p>
        <p><span class = 'note'>Pro tip: Your Barista hates it when you order some "Black Eye"
        "Green Eye" etc. Your Barista loves it when you order "A 16 oz. coffee with two shots of
        espresso and room for cream." </p> </span>
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Ristretto</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Espresso pulled "short", generally about .75 oz per shot rather than the usual 1 oz. 
        Generally generates a richer drink with more acidity and more floral or citrus notes and
        less bittersweet caramel flavor.</p>
    </dd>
                        
    <dt><b>Shot in the dark</b></dt>
        <dd><p>A synonym for a Red Eye. See Red Eye.</p>
    </dd>
                            
    <dt><b>Turkish coffee</b></dt> 
        <dd><p><img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/turkishm33.JPG' />
        A very strong coffee made with an ibrik, traditionally drunk black with sugar. Often
        cardamom and/or other spices are added. This preperation leaves the grounds in the bottom
        of the serving cup.</p>

    <dt><b>Vietnamese iced coffee</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Strong coffee (often brewed with chicory) or espresso with sweetened condensed milk poured
        over ice. Also called Thai iced coffee.</p>
