    <div class="main"> <h3> Coffee has a lot of caffeine in it. </h3>
            <p> Firstly, coffee is measured in six ounce cups, and most coffee has about 100 mg of caffeine per "cup". Most
            American mugs are 12-16 ounces in volume, so they contain between two and three "cups" of
            coffee, and between 200 and 300 mg of caffeine.</p>
            <p>A single shot of espresso contains around 50 mg caffeine--less than a
            cup of coffee. A two ounce double shot (the amount most commonly used in espresso drinks) will generally have
            about the same amount of caffeine as a six ounce cup of brewed coffee.</p>
            <p>Cheap coffee usually contains 20-50% more caffeine than good coffee. There are two main types of coffee: Arabica, which is considered the standard in high quality coffee; and Robusta, which is cheaper and easier to grow in varied conditions. While a cup of Arabica coffee has around 100 mg of caffeine in it, a cup of Robusta will have between 125 and 150 mg.</p>
            <p>Most other caffeinated drinks contain significantly less caffeine than coffee. A can of Coca-Cola
            has 35mg, tea can vary widely, but generally has between 15 and 70mg per 8 ounce cup, and a
            chocolate bar has about 5mg. Some energy drinks have about as much
            caffeine per ounce as coffee, and a few "energy shot" type drinks have far, far more. </p>
            <p>Decaffeination does not remove all of the caffeine from coffee, but it does remove 98-99%
            of it, leaving decaf coffee with one to two mg of caffeine per cup, less than is in chocolate. </p>
