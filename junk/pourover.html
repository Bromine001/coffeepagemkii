            <p>Pour overs are great for making coffee for one. It makes a good cup of drip coffee right
            into your mug. Never feeling obliged to drink or throw out the last cup from your automatic
            drip maker is a great boon. <br>
            There are several different devices for making a pour over.  For this I'll be using a Hario V-60.
            The directions will be virtually identical with other such devices.</p>

            <img src= 'cpics/v60m02.JPG' title= 'everything you need' />
            <p>Here's what you'll need. Your V-60, a paper filter, a cup, some fresh ground coffee,
                and some boiling water (not pictured).</p>

            <img src= 'cpics/v60m01.JPG' title= 'digital scales are the best' />
            <p>Use your scale to weigh out your coffee. We are making a 10 ounce cup, so we want 17 grams
            of coffee grounds. You want a fine grind for this, a little finer than you'd use for a flat bottom
            drip machine, a little coarser than a coarse espresso setting. </p>

            <p>Boil some water in your kettle, then turn it off.  Give it a minute to cool from 212 to about 205.</p>

            <p>Place your paper filter into your brewer and pour a little water onto it, to rinse your filter
            and pre-warm your mug.</p>
            <p>Pour out the water in your mug. This is really important, and really easy to miss.

            <p>Pour the grounds into your filter, then slowly pour water from your kettle into the
            grounds, making sure to wet them completely.</p>

            <p>Pour water onto the grounds, making sure to not let all the water run out of the filter (it can
            clog the paper with fines). 
            Set the brewer in the sink to finish dripping.    </p>
