    <title>Turkish Coffee</title>

    </div>
            <p>An Ibrik is used to make Turkish or Greek coffee. This is a style of very strong, usually
            very sweet, often spiced coffee commonly drunk in the Middle East. It goes by many names,
            and there are quite a few variations. Here I will show the variation that I learned. As
            there are so many variations, I don't claim it to be the definitive method, but it is a serviceable
            one. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm11.JPG' title= 'stuff you need' />
            <p>Start by gathering your materials. You'll need your sugarbowl, your ibrik, measuring spoons,
            coffee grounds, water, and a stirring utensil (not pictured).</p>
    </div>

        <img src= 'cpics/hario.JPG' title = 'Hario mini hand mill' />
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm09.JPG' title= 'Really' />
            <p>Grind coffee as finely as possible. A blade grinder will not work, as it leaves some
            particles much too large. Most home burr grinders won't work either as they leave ALL
            the particles slightly too large. You should use a Turkish coffee grinder or another hand
            mill, like the Hario mini mill here. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm06.JPG' title= 'SUPER fine' />
            <p>You really do want the coffee to be nearly flour fine.
 
            It will go stale very quickly, so wait to grind until you are about to brew your coffee. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm12.JPG' title='Add the water' />
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm16.JPG' title='and the sugar' />
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm14.JPG' title='and coffee' />
            <p>Pour cold water into the ibrik, up to just below the neck. It is important to know how
            much water you are putting in, as that governs how much coffee to use. Turkish coffee is powerful
            stuff, usually served in demitasse cups; the standard serving is two ounces. <br>
            For each 2 ounce
            serving, add one teaspoon of sugar, then one heaping teaspoon of coffee.  The coffee goes on top.
            DO NOT STIR. Just let the water moisten the grounds as it heats up.<br>
            Here, we are using an 8 ounce ibrik, so I'm putting in 8 ounces of water and 4 heaping tsp coffee. <br>
            You can leave out the sugar if you like, though it's really best to include it, even if you
            don't normally put sugar in your coffee. There's an old saying about Turkish coffee that
            it should be &quot;black as night and sweet as sin&quot;. So, at least the first time
            you make it, include the sugar.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm18.JPG' title='careful with your handle' />
            <p>Heat the pot slowly, over medium heat. <br>
            Make sure you don't get your ibrik handle over the flame. It will certainly get hot, and
            if it's the same style pictured here, it will burn up. </p>
    </div>

        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm25.JPG' title='foaming up!' />
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm24.JPG' title='I use a plastic chopstick to stir' />
            <p>Watch closely, and when it starts to foam up, take it off the heat and stir it down.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm26.JPG' title='second time!' />
            Put the pot back on the heat and let it foam back up.
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm30.JPG' title='Last time!' />
            Repeat a third time, but do not stir it down.
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm32.JPG' title='pour' />
            <p>Pour into cups. Make sure to preserve the foam on top, which is a key part of this
            style of coffee. Always give your guest the cup with the most foam on top.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm33.JPG' title='Coffee!' />
        <p>Coffee! <br>
        Remember, there are grounds at the bottom. Make sure to let the grounds settle for a moment
        before drinking. <br>
        You can sip carefully and leave the bed
        of grounds in your cup.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src= 'cpics/turkishm31.JPG' title='Spice' />
        <p> Side note: Coffee spice. <br>
            You can flavor your coffee with a very small amount of cardamom or a mix of
            cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. Generally you want about 1/8 tsp. per serving.
            I keep a jar with cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves ground and mixed together. You can add a pinch of spice at
            the beginning when you add the sugar, or you can put the spice into your cup before pouring
            or on the table, to let each guest add his own. <br>
            I prefer putting the spice in my cup before pouring the coffee in, so prevent stirring up
            the grounds in the cup. <br>
