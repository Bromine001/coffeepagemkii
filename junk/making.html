        <h3> Some methods for brewing coffee</h3>
            <p>This is not meant to be exhaustive, but is meant to be representative.</p>
    <h4>How much coffee to use</h4>
                <img class = 'imLeft' src = 'cpics/brewChart.JPG' title= 'enormously useful but highly confusing chart'/>
            <p> Most people don't put enough ground coffee beans into their coffee. It's an easy mistake to make.
            Not using enough grounds will make your coffee taste very bitter.  Many people associate this with
            coffee being too strong. It seems counter intuitive, but the opposite is true, and here's why: in
            making coffee, the goal is not to extract all the soluble compounds from the grounds, only some of
            them.  Too weak a brew allows the water to dissolve many undesirable
            compounds into your extract, which carry an excessively bitter taste.</p>
            <p>This chart can be hard to read, but a good baseline rule is a 1:17 ratio of coffee:water.
            Depending on your exact method for extraction, this ratio may vary.   </p>
            <p>The water needs to be 195-205 degrees F (90-96 C) for optimal extraction.
            Lower tempratures will result in flat, underdeveloped flavors, while higher temperatures
            will extract undesired compounds. </p>
            <p>Time in contact with the water will vary based on the particle size of the coffee you are using.
            It can vary from anywhere between about 8 seconds for espresso, to steeping for about 3 minutes for French press.
            The time is only a general trend, and will of course also vary based on the exact method you are using.</p>
            <br>
<h4> <b>How to grind coffee </b></h4>
        <p><img class= 'imLeft' src='cpics/burrGrinder.jpeg' title= 'Hario burr grinder, highly recommended' /> Burr grinders are preffered for grinding coffee
        <a class= 'noDeco' href = 'http://gearpatrol.com/2013/02/25/grind-it-out-10-best-coffee-grinders/'>(shop for
        burr grinder here)</a>. A burr grinder works by the action of a toothed plate that spins at a set distance
        from a second toothed plate, which is fixed in place. <img class= 'imRight' src='cpics/pressm06.JPG' title ='Hopper full of coffee' />The coffee beans are poured into the center,
        and make their way towards the edges, and can only fit through between the edges of the plate once they have
        been ground to a sufficently small size. Once they have reached the edge, the grounds will fall into a collection
        hopper, and be away from any further grinding. Burr grinders are used in all professional applications where
        coffee is ground.  If you're serious about your coffee, the investment in a decent home grade burr grinder is
        well worth the expense.  Blade grinders mostly work, and are much less expensive. They
        generate a very irregular particle size, which is less than ideal for any sort of coffee application.

            <img class = 'imRight' src='cpics/coffeeTiny.JPG' title= 'Coffee!' />
            <p>A standard size French press carafe will hold 32 ounces total. After the grounds are in, that
            leaves room for about 30 ounces of water. I weigh out 1.8 ounces of beans for my
            French press. </p>
            <p>Start by grinding fresh coffee coarsely.</p>
            <p>Pour them into your press.</p>
            <p>Boil some water in your kettle, give it a minute to cool from 212 to about 205,
            pour the water over your grounds, give it a stir with a wooden or plastic utensil.</p>
            <p>Set a timer for 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>Put the lid on, and adjust the plunger so that the grounds
            are held under the surface of the water. This helps to ensure that all the grounds are held under the
            surface of the water. </p>
            <p>When your time is up, gently but firmly push the plunger down and pour.</p>  </dd>
        
     
        <dt><br><b>Espresso</b></dt>
            <dd>
            <img class = 'imLeft' src= 'cpics/espresso1.JPG' />We don't recommend trying to make
            espresso at home. Proper espresso requires an extremely temperature stable source of water,
            which means a big boiler. It also requires enormously high pressure to pull properly, and
            to extract all of the desired compounds from the grounds, 9 bars of pressure to be exact.
            Espresso is also the trickiest method of coffee making, needing constant adjustment of both the
            grinder and of the machine itself. It is so tricky, in fact, that many baristas aren't able to
            do a decent job with it. 
            There are plenty of
            &quot;home espresso&auot; machines out there, but few of them make a drink that bears more than a
            passing resemblance to espresso. If you can't live without your espresso fix at home, you
            have two good options. The first is the <a class= noDeco href='http://www.laspaziale.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=66&lang=en'>
            Spaziale Vivaldi S1</a>, a high quality
            pro-sumer machine that makes pretty good espresso. The second doesn't make espresso, but
            makes a concentrated coffee extract which is as closer than most home espresso machines
            can make.</dd>

            <p>Place your paper filter into your brewer. Pour a little water onto it to rinse your filter

            <p>Pour the grounds into your filter, then slowly pour the water from your kettle into the

            <p>Don't let all of the water drain out from the brewer until you are finished.  This can
            clog the filter with fines. Just keep topping it with water from your kettle every few
            seconds.</p>
            <p>Set the brewer in the sink to finish dripping. </p>
            <p>Enjoy your coffee.</p> </dd>

        <dt><br><b>Automatic drip</b></dt>
            <dd> <img class= 'imLeft' src= cpics/mrCoffee.JPG title= 'It&#39s a coffee maker.' />
            <p>Most automatic drip machines have some issues. They can't make particularly
            good coffee for two reasons. First, they only get the water to about 185 degrees. Second,
            they cannot hold enough coffee to make the proper strength brew. Yes, this is actually true.
            For the full 60 ounces
            in a 12 cup maker, you should have about 3.25 ounces of coffee grounds, which would
            overfill the basket. </p>
            <p>Here are some directions for getting the most out of your automatic drip maker.</p>
            <p>First, grind some coffee to a medium grind. Use a finer grind if you have a cone filter, or a
            coarser grind if you are using a mesh basket.</p>
            <p>Put a filter into the brewing basket, and fill about halfway with fresh grounds. Don't fill
            it further than halfway, since the coffee needs room to mix with water. If you overfill the basket, it will
            overflow and make a giant mess.</p>
            <p>Fill the carafe about halfway -- to the 6 cup mark in most makers. </p>
            <p>Pour into the reservoir and turn it on.</p>
            <p> Wait until it's done making noise, then turn off the hot plate and enjoy your coffee! You can pour it into
            a thermos if you want to keep your coffee hot for longer than 20 minutes or so.
            <span class= note>Pro tip: Do not use the &quot;steal a cup&quot; feature. It will not only
            wind you up with a poor cup of coffee, it will also degrade the entire pot.</span></p> </dd>

            <p><span class = 'note'>Note: this recipe does not follow the general 1:17 rule; it

            <p>Place a paper filter into the filter basket. </p>
            <p>Turn your aero press upside down, slide the plunger to the bottom of the 4 circle. </p>
            <p>Pour your grounds into the body of your aero press. </p>

            <p>This is my favorite way to make coffee when I don't have my French press. I use it
            when camping or sometimes when I need more than the 30 ounces I can make in the press.
            The beauty of this method is that it can be scaled up as much as you like; you just need
            a bag big enough to catch the grounds and a container big enough to catch the coffee.</p>
            <p>Start with a simple bag sewn out of muslin. </p>
            <p>Grind some coffee coarsely (remember our 1:17 ratio). </p>
            <p><span class = 'note'> Note: I like to make about 26 ounces of coffee at a time,
            so I start with 1.5 ounces grounds. </span> </p>
            <p>Boil some water, and let it cool for a minute from 212 to 205. </p>
            <p>Place the colador into a second pot (or bottle or mug). </p>
            <p>Pour your measured grounds into the colador. </p>
            <p>Pour water over your grounds. Let it steep for three minutes. As you pour the water, the
            edges of your cloth bag might try to get away into your coffee. It needs to be held in place.
            Be very careful to either wear a glove in this stage or to not pour hot water over your hand.
            I sometimes use a rubber band to hold the bag in place.</p>
            <p>Pull the colador out of the coffee, let drip for a few seconds. </p>
            <p>Shake out the grounds, and rinse the colador. </p>

            where to buy a Colador</a>
            This works just like a camping colador, simply follow the same directions, using your purchased
            colador instead of your musilin bag. </p>
            <p>A downside of this method is that it can't scale up, but an upside is that if you buy a
            colador, it will have a handle built in.  This can save you some scaleded fingers if you aren't
            careful pouring hot water.</p>

        <dt><br><b>Ibrik, Cezve, Briki</b> <a class = seeMore href='turkish.html'>see more</a></dt>

            <p>An Ibrik is used to make Turkish or Greek coffee. This is a style of coffee common to the
            Middle East, and is known by many names. I really like it as an afternoon or evening coffee
            to accompany conversation, especially if served along with a hookah.</p>
            <p>Grind coffee as finely as possible. A blade grinder will not work, as it leaves some
            particles much too large. Most home burr grinders won't work either as they leave ALL
            the particles slightly too large. You should use a turkish coffee grinder or another hand
            mill, like the Hario mini mill pictured to the right.<img class = 'imRight' src= 'cpics/hario.JPG' title = 'Hario mini hand mill' />
            It's especially important that the coffee be ground
            very finely, as in this preparation the grounds will float to the surface if they are too large.</p> 
            <p>It will go stale very quickly, so wait to grind until you are about to brew your coffee. </p>
            <p>Pour cold water into the ibrik, 2 ounces per serving. For each serving, add one tsp. sugar,
            then one heaping tsp. grounds on top. <b>Do not stir yet.</b> </p>
            <p>Heat the pot slowly, over medium heat. </p>
            <p>Watch closely, and when it starts to foam up, take it off the heat and stir down. </p>
            <p>Put the ibrik back on the heat, let it foam back up, and stir down again. </p>
            <p>Repeat a third time, but do not stir down. </p>
            <p>Pour into cups. </p>
            <p>Flavor with a knife tip of turkish coffee spice (optional).</p>

            <p>This method for making coffee is unsuitable for drinking hot, it will result in a flat, boring
            cup of coffee with virtually no acidity.  (Many people think it makes tasty iced coffee.) </p>
            <p>Some companies that build equipment specifically designed to make cold press coffee
            make false claims that their coffee has &quot;67% less acid&quot; than other coffees. Do not
            fall for this hype. Coffee has less acid than many common beverages, including tomato juice,
            lemonade, and Coca-Cola. See my article <a class= 'noDeco' href='random.html'>here</a>.</p></dd>
