    <p>An AeroPress is a great way to make a single cup of coffee at a time. Once you have a kettle of hot water,
it only takes a few moments to make coffee with the AeroPress, so it's also great for making two or three cups
in quick succession. It doesn't use any electricity, so it's great for camping or trips.</p></div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm07.JPG' title='All the stuff and more!'>
            <p>Collect up your supplies. Here we have all the things you'll need. A kettle of water,
            your AeroPress (all three pieces), a filter, a scale, ground coffee, and a stirring tool.
            In this case, I've already weighed and ground the coffee. You can start by putting your
            kettle on to boil, and then get everything ready while it is heating up.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/scale04.JPG' title='The scale'>
            <p>Grind some coffee (17 grams) to a fine grind (as you would use for a cone filter automatic
            drip maker). <span class = 'note'>note: this
            recipe does not follow the general 1:17 rule; it makes a concentrated
            extract similar to espresso.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm02.JPG' title='An AeroPress comes with about 400 of these, and they
        are really cheap to restock.'>
            <p>Place a paper filter into the filter basket. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm01.JPG' title='By the makers of the Aerobie!'>
            <p>Turn your AeroPress upside down. Slide the plunger to the bottom of the 4 circle.
            This is counter to the directions included with your AeroPress, but placing it upside
            down prevents it from dripping before you want to push down the plunger.</p>

        <img src='cpics/aeropressm05.JPG' title='It comes with a funnel, but you do not need it unless
        you want to.'>
            <p>Pour your grounds into the body of your AeroPress. </p>

    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm20.JPG' title='It&#39;s always important to rinse off paper filters.'>
            <p>Boil some water. Pour a little water into your basket to rinse off the filter and
            pre warm your mug. <br> Pour the water out of your mug. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm22.JPG' title='No time to waste now!'>
            <p>Pour in water up to the top of the 2 circle.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm23.JPG' title='Just two or three stirs will do it. Make sure the grounds
        are all wet.'>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm11.JPG' title='It just screws on, takes about a 1/8 turn.'>
            <p>Give it a quick stir, clap the basket on, and invert over the mug.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm12.JPG' title='Just push the plunger down.'>
            <p>Press the plunger down. Be gentle but firm. If you press too hard or fast, the filter will clog
            with fines and it will be nearly impossible to push the rest out. Stop when it starts hissing.
            At that point, the water is out and you are done. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm26.JPG' title='It just pops right out.'>
            <p>Pull the basket off and push the plunger all the way though to pop the puck out. Hold it over the
            compost or trash can, and it should just come out in one piece.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src='cpics/aeropressm28.JPG' title='All done!'>
            <p>Coffee!
            Top off your mug with hot water (if desired).</p>
