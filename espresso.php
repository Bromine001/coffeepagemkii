        <h3>Espresso.</h3>
        <h4>All you ever wanted to know and more.</h4>

        Many blends are labeled "espresso blend". This does not mean that they are only used for
        espresso, or that they are only good for espresso, or that they are &quot;stronger&quot;.
        The concentrated nature of espresso means that any flaw in the beans will become
        readily apparent to the drinker, so nearly every coffee roaster creates a specific blend
        that they use for their espresso, which will often be labeled "espresso blend". This really
        indicates that it is a blend of beans that has been very carefully balanced so that it will
        make good espresso. That careful balancing will also mean it will be good with any sort of extraction
        method you choose to use.</p>
        
        <p><img class= 'bigLeft' src= 'cpics/espresso3.JPG' />Espresso is generally sold by the one ounce "shot".
        It is generally served in demitasse cups,
        sometimes with a piece of chocolate, a slice of lemon, or a sugar cube. Many coffeeshops pull their
        espresso two shots at a time, in a &quot;double&quot; portafilter. Due to a combination of this and its
        generally small volume, the most common quantity of espresso is the "double shot", somewhat
        obviously consisting of two shots pulled from a single portafilter.</p>
